# Roll
## Project Description:
Roll is an Android App that answers the question of **"What should I do today?"**

The app has two navigation screens: **Roll and Deck**.

Upon opening the app, the **Roll** screen is displayed. This screen features a dice that is activated by a tap or x-axis shake to generate a random activty. The user can choose to roll again or mark that activity as completed. The purpose of the app is to be opened whenever the user is stuck on *what to do* for that day. 

The **Deck** holds all of the user's adventure ideas, where they can create custom categories and input their activities or destinations. In the deck, the user can "roll" from a select category and view the address or notes about the selected activity.
